This lab must be completed during your scheduled lab time before you leave! If you are unable to create a drawing with Visual Paradigm, submit a hand-drawn version before leaving the lab and later create a Visual Paradigm drawing and submit it. The VP drawing should be the same as the hand-drawn version.

Visual Paradigm

Visual Paradigm (VP) is a drawing tool. It has multi versions, such as community edition, modeler edition, standard edition, etc.  Since you only need to draw a simple class model, you can use the free online version:  Visual Paradigm.
